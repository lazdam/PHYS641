I have submitted both the jupyter notebook, alongside of the PDF version of the notebook and a second PDF containing my analytic work done by hand.
Note that in the PDF version of the jupyter notebook, symbols such as \lambda do not render (so you may see some blank spaces). This 
is fixed if you look at the .ipynb file.
